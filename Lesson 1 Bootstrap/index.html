                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">The experiment aimed to determine if the ginger rhizome, when added to soil, can
                        significantly increase the height of Wisconsin Fast Plants. It was hypothesized that the variety of
                        nutrients such as antioxidants in ginger, in addition to compounds produced by any endophytic
                        bacteria, would help the Wisconsin Fast Plants grow. The prediction was that plants in soil
                        containing a higher ginger concentration would become taller than plants in soil with a lower
                        ginger concentration. The experiment was conducted with 5 test levels: 14 plants were given no
                        soil, 14 were given soil with no ginger, 14 were given soil with 20g of ginger, 14 were given soil
                        with 40 g of ginger, and 14 were given soil with 80g of ginger. The height of each plant was
                        collected once a week for 35 days, and the data was then graphed to look for trends. ANOVA and
                        t-tests were also performed to determine which groups were significantly different from others.
                        As the amount of ginger increased, the number of dead plants increased, but the heights of the
                        living plants were greater than those of the control plants. The findings of the experiment were
                        that small amounts of ginger boosted plant growth, but larger amounts change the composition of
                        the soil too much, and create an environment that the plants are not capable of surviving in.</p>
