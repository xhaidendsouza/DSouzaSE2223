                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">The experiment aimed to determine if the ginger rhizome, when added to soil, can significantly increase the height of Wisconsin Fast Plants. It was hypothesized that the variety of nutrients such as antioxidants in ginger, in addition to compounds produced by any endophytic bacteria, would help the Wisconsin Fast Plants grow. The prediction was that plants in soil containing a higher ginger concentration would become taller than plants in soil with a lower ginger concentration. The experiment was conducted with 5 test levels, each with 14 plants: no soil, soil with no ginger, soil with 20g of ginger, soil with 40 g of ginger, and soil with 80g of ginger. The height of each plant was collected once a week for 35 days, and the data was then graphed to look for trends.</p>

                    <h1 id = "ovPadRight">Rationale</h1>
                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadRight">Bacteria that lives in between the plant cells of the Zingiber officinale rhizome, also known as endophytic bacteria, promote growth of the ginger plant. These bacteria can
                        produce compounds that may boost the growth of other plants as well. In addition, ginger has antioxidants that may protect Wisconsin Fast Plants from free radicals produced by a variety of internal and external stressors. This would cause the plants to be healthier, and therefore grow taller. Also, since ginger is a natural substance and not synthetic, it may have many benefits associated with organic fertilizers, which are fertilizers created from natural materials.</p>

It is taken in sophmore year, after the Introduction to Research course taken in freshman year. Research Practicum allows students to do research in a variety of subjects: from artificial intelligence, to head injury analysis, to plant growth like in this experiment. In addition, you can pursue an engineering design project instead.</p>
